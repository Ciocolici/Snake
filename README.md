# Snake
This is my first Java project, the beloved Snake game. I created it for my probe project in classes. Since I am just learning to write in Java, I've struggled a lot. I couldn't implement everything I wanted. The game is missing two features I intended it to have: the ability to restart the game after game over and to record the highest score. For the first feature, I tried everything but couldn't get it to work. As for the latter, I didn't have enough time due to the deadline in classes.

For the icon, I used the following:

*I exported the project as a .jar file (Snake by Cioco.jar) so that anyone can run the file and play the game. However, I am unsure if it works properly. It didn't work for me, despite my efforts to fix it. I encountered many issues importing the JavaFX Framework into my project using the Eclipse IDE, and I might not have done it correctly, resulting in the inability to export the runnable jar file correctly. If the file doesn't work (which is likely), the only way to run the game is by opening the project in a Java-supported IDE.*
