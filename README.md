# Snake
This is my first Java project, the beloved Snake game. I created it for my IHK probe project in the Application Development classes. Since I am just learning to write in Java, I've struggled a lot. I couldn't implement everything I wanted. The game is missing two features I intended it to have: the ability to restart the game after game over and to record the highest score. For the first feature, I tried everything but couldn't get it to work. As for the latter, I didn't have enough time due to the deadline in classes.

For the icon, I used the following:

This project was heavily inspired by this:

The following are all in german:
- "Probeprojekt Antrag (korrigiert).pdf" is the application for the probe project.
- "Probeprojekt Snake Dokumentation.pdf" is the documentation for the probe project.
- "Feedback.docx" is the feedback I have received from my trainer for the application and the documentation.
- "Probeprojekt Snake Pr√§sentation.pdf" is the presentation for the probe project.
 
*I exported the project as a .jar file (Snake by Cioco.jar) so that anyone can run the file and play the game. However, I am unsure if it works properly. It didn't work for me, despite my efforts to fix it. I encountered many issues importing the JavaFX Framework into my project using the Eclipse IDE, and I might not have done it correctly, resulting in the inability to export the runnable jar file correctly. If the file doesn't work (which is likely), the only way to run the game is by opening the project in a Java-supported IDE.*
