# Snake
This is my first Java project, the beloved Snake game. I created it for my IHK probe project in the Application Development classes by Lutz & Grub Academy. Since I am just learning to write in Java, I've struggled a lot to do it on time, and due to the class deadline, I wasn’t able to implement two planned features: restarting the game after a game over and saving the high score. I made several attempts to get the restart feature working but couldn't get it to function correctly in time.

This project was heavily inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmChebZcb2U). (big thanks to the creator)

*The following are all in german:*
- *"Probeprojekt Antrag (korrigiert).pdf" is the application for the probe project.*
- *"Probeprojekt Snake Dokumentation.pdf" is the documentation for the probe project.*
- *"Feedback.docx" is the feedback I have received from my trainer for the application and the documentation.*
- *"Probeprojekt Snake Präsentation.pdf" is the presentation for the probe project.*
 
*I exported the project as a .jar file (Snake by Cioco.jar) so that anyone can run the file and play the game. However, I am unsure if it works properly. It didn't work for me, despite my efforts to fix it. I encountered many issues importing the JavaFX Framework into my project using the Eclipse IDE, and I might not have done it correctly, resulting in the inability to export the runnable jar file correctly. If the file doesn't work (which is likely), the only way to run the game is by opening the project in a Java-supported IDE.*
