# Snake

This is my first Java project, a recreation of the classic Snake game. It was developed as part of my IHK trial project during my retraining as an IT Specialist in Application Development at Lutz + Grub Academy.

ðŸš€ How to Run

**Option 1: From IDE (Recommended)**

- Open the project in a Java-supported IDE (e.g. Eclipse or IntelliJ).
- Ensure JavaFX is correctly installed and linked.
- Run the main class.

**Option 2: Runnable JAR (Not guaranteed to work)**

- File: Snake by Cioco.jar
  
  Due to unresolved issues with JavaFX and Eclipse integration, this JAR file may not run properly. If it doesn't work, please use the IDE method above.

ðŸŽ“ Acknowledgements

This project was initially based on [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmChebZcb2U), which provided a foundational implementation of the Snake game in Java. I followed the tutorial to understand the structure and logic, then adapted and extended the project by customizing the code and adding features.
Big thanks to the original creator for the guidance and foundation.

ðŸ’¬ This was my first project in Java, and a real challenge to complete within the given timeframe. It taught me a lot about game programming, UI integration, and working under pressure.
